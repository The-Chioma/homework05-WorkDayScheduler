# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

I have created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the working day. This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and will run in the browser.

## How it works
GIVEN you are using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN you open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN you scroll down

THEN you am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

WHEN you view the time blocks for that day

THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN you click into a time block

THEN you can enter an event

WHEN you click the save button for that time block

THEN you text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN you refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist
